# WinAVR

The [WinAVR](http://winavr.sourceforge.net/) project is abandoned, but there has been a huge progess in recent years in the gcc compiler, which is far more efficient on the Atmega plaftorm than any other solution.

You can consider this project a fork of the original Win-AVR, powered by modern technologies.
